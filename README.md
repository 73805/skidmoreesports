## Skidmore's eSports Club website
I designed and developed this single-page site in the summer of 2015 to get the club out on the web.

The site provides some copy about the club, displays our ever-growing array of swag, and lists a filter-able array of current players.

It's plain old html/css with a bit of angular for the filtering. It's fully responsive and should look presentable on any device.
