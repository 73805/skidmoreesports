## Skidmore's eSports Club website
I designed and developed this single-page site in the summer of 2015 to get the club out on the web.

The site provides some copy about the club, displays our ever-growing array of swag, and features a filter-able list of current players.

The code is pretty straight forward; plain old html/css with a bit of angular for the filtering. The site is fully responsive and should look presentable on any device.
